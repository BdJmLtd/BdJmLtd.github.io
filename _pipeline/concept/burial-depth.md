title:  "Burial Depth"

## 最小埋深

All underground pipes are buried with a minimum cover of 500 -1000 mm on top of the pipe
known as the minimum depth of cover.
The actual depth of cover may vary depending on stress analysis requirements, rail/road calculation, etc.
In practice, the more is the depth of cover the better it is, but the same will increase project installation cost.
So, an optimized depth of cover is decided by buried piping stress analysis.
