A point cloud is a database of points that represent a digital 3D physical object or space in the 3D coordinate system.
It consists of millions of individual measurement points with an x, y, and z coordinate.
3D Point cloud is a highly accurate digital record of an object.
Point clouds are utilized to generate 3D meshes and other models for 3D modeling.

Based on the sensors used and the method to capture the cloud,
each point can also include RGB color data or intensity information.
These data reflect the return strength of the laser pulse that generated the point.
Note that, points in each 3D point cloud are always located on the external surfaces of the visible objects.
Ray of light from the scanner is reflected from the object to create these spots.

The denser the points in the point cloud, the more detailed is the object representation capturing even smaller details.
The process by which these point cloud data are converted into a 3D model is known as point cloud processing.
The time taken to create a point cloud depends on the number of required scans and the density of scanning.
The normal mobile scanner takes much lesser time compared to advanced scanners.

## Generation of a Point Cloud

A point cloud is usually captured using any of the following two tools:

- Laser Scanners or
- Photogrammetry
