## 压强

<p>
\(1Mpa\)是压强单位
</p>

<p>
\(1Mpa = 10kg/cm^{2}\)，那么\(0.5Mpa = 5kg/cm^{2}\)
</p>

<p>
\(1kg/cm^{2}\)的水扬程是10米，\(5kg/cm^{2}\)的水扬程是50米。
</p>

<p>
根据公式计算，\(65米=6.5kg/cm^{2}=0.65Mpa\)
</p>

## 体积

<p>
\(1加仑=3.78533升\)
</p>

<p>
\(1立方米=1000升\)
</p>

Although a well managed system can have an **ILI** of 1.0 (CARL = UARL),
this does not necessarily have to be the target as the ILI is a purely technical performance indicator
and does not take economic considerations into account.
For any water distribution system there is a level of leakage below
which is it not cost-effective to make further investment
or use additional resources to drive leakage down further.
In other words, the value of the water saved is less than the cost of making further reduction.
