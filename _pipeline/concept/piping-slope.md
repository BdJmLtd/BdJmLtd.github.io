title:  "Piping Slope"
---

The piping slope is the change in elevation with respect to its flat horizontal position.

> 含义

The piping slope is provided in various piping systems mainly due to free draining requirements.
A slope in the pipe helps the liquid to flow easily in the downward direction.
So, it helps in avoiding the accumulation of liquid inside the piping system.
This in turn helps the system to eliminate two-phase slug flow problems.

Note that, the piping slope can also be denoted as `1/100` or `1%`.
Both of these are the same as `1:100`.
All of these define the height deviation with respect to a certain length.

## Piping Slope Calculation

Some thumb rules that are prevalent in the industry are listed below:

- All piping are sloped down a minimum of ¹⁄₈ in/ft (10 mm/ m), in the direction of ﬂow.
- It is common practice to design sanitary sewers with slopes sufficient to provide for velocities of 2 ft/s (0.6 m/s) when ﬂowing full. Experience shows that with such slopes, trouble from deposits is seldom encountered.
