## 串行通信 vs. 并行通信

In telecommunication, the process of sending data sequentially over a computer bus is called as **serial communication**,
which means the data will be transmitted bit by bit.
While in **parallel communication**
the data is transmitted in a byte (8 bit) or character on several data lines or buses at a time.

**Serial communication** is slower than **parallel communication**
but used for long data transmission due to lower cost and practical reasons.

Example to understand:

- **Serial communication** – you are shooting a target using machine guns, where bullets reach one by one to the target.
- **Parallel communication**- you are shooting a target using a shotgun, where many number of the bullets reach at the same time.

在通信和计算机科学中，Serial Communication 是一个通用概念，泛指所有的串行的通信协议，如 RS232、USB、I2C、SPI、1-Wire、Ethernet 等。
这里的串行（Serial），是相对并行通信（Parallel Communication）来说的。

RS232 = Recommended Standard 232 

## RS232

The term RS232 stands for "Recommended Standard 232" and
it is a type of **serial communication** used for transmission of data normally in medium distances.
It was introduced back in the 1960s and has found its way into many applications
like computer printers, factory automation devices etc.

## full-duplex or half-duplex

The **distance** between the devices directly impacts **communication speed**.
Serial communication can be established in either **full-duplex** or **half-duplex** mode.

Full-duplex allows data to be sent and received simultaneously by using different wires for transmission and reception.

In a half-duplex implementation,
a single line is used for both transmitting and receiving data resulting in more limited operation.
Half-duplex can be set to transmit or receive data, but not both at the same time.

## RS232 vs. RS485

Important differences between RS232 and RS485 have to do with four basic factors
that can affect their serviceability in various applications:

- Distance of operation
- Number of transmitters and receivers
- Electrical noise and ground reference potential
- Data speed

### RS485 VS. RS232: THE NAME GAME

RS232 is now officially known as **EIA/TIA-232-F**.
EIA/TIA stands for Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association,
and the “F” indicates the latest update.

RS485 is now **TIA-485**.

To keep up with the times, we'll continue to call them **TIA-232** and **TIA-485** from here on out.

### DISTANCE OF OPERATION

The maximum distance between transmitter and receiver for **TIA-232** is about 50 ft.,
although the length can be extended considerably if data rates are low.

For **TIA-485**, the distance of operation is significantly longer -- up to 4,000 ft.

Keep in mind that RS485/422 is multidrop, while RS232 is only point to point.

The maximum operational distance between a transmitter and a receiver for RS232 is 15 Meters.
However, the length can be extended considerably with a trade-off with slower data rates.

For RS485, the distance is remarkably longers of up to 1200 Meters.
That's 24 times the distance of RS232.
It will only be reasonable to pick RS485 if the equipment is meant to operate at a distance from the transmitter.

### NUMBER OF TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS

A **TIA-232** serial interface is for connecting two devices.
There's one transmitter (driver) and one receiver.

With a **TIA-485** interface, one device is able to control 32 other devices or more.

It's important to note that TIA-232 and TIA-485 are not fixed.
For example, the USB interface is often used on newer equipment.
Sometimes, however, making different kinds of equipment or older and newer devices work together
requires conversion from **USB to TIA-232 or TIA-485** or **TIA 485 or TIA-232 to USB**.
It might also be necessary to convert TIA-232 to TIA-485, or the reverse.

### ELECTRICAL NOISE AND GROUND REFERENCE POTENTIAL

**TIA-232** is a voltage level-based system that functions well
when differences in ground reference potential are minimal.
But in electrically noisy industrial machines or on equipment in locations with different potential levels,
TIA-232 can prove too fragile and allow data corruption.

**TIA-485**, by contrast, demonstrates higher levels of noise immunity.
Its differential voltage system is more suitable to industrial applications
because it provides common mode noise immunity.
The differential operation also accounts for the longer data transfer distance and the lower voltage use,
which also helps increase data speed.

### DATA SPEED

For short distances and low data speed requirements, a **TIA-232** serial interface is more than adequate.
It transfers data at 1 Mbps to 15m. maximum.

> RS232 最大传输距离标准值为 15 米。
> 在传输距离为 15 米时，传输速率为 1 Mbps。

However, to 50 ft., a **TIA-485** interface can transmit data at a rate of 10 Mbps.
At the maximum distance of 1200m, **TIA-485** transmits at 100 kbps.

> RS485 最大无线传输距离为 1200 米。
> 在传输距离为 15 米时，传输速率为 10 Mbps；在传输距离为 1200 米时，传输速率为 100 kb/s。

RS232 is more than able to perform for a short distance and low data speed requirements.
RS232 has a transmission speed of 1Mb/s up to 15M.
However, RS485 has a data transmission speed of up to 10Mb/s for a distance of 15M.
At the maximum of 1200M, RS485 transmits at 100Kb/s.

### The number of wires

An RS232 cable is typically comprised of 9 different wires, though in some connectors, 25 wires are used.
Each wire serves a distinct purpose in the data transmission.

RS485 cables only have three wires, 2 for data transmission and 1 for the ground.

### Two-way transmission

RS232 is full-duplex, meaning that it can transmit data in both directions, both sending and receiving.

To achieve duplex communication with RS485 you need another set of wires.
Native RS485 is half-duplex, meaning it can only transmit in one direction at a time.

### Voltage

RS485 uses voltages between +5V and -5V.

The recommended voltage for RS232 is +12V to -12V, and signals degraded to as low as 3V can still be understood.

### Range

There are significant differences in the cable lengths that can be used with the RS232 and RS485 protocols.

RS232 cables are generally restricted to being 50 feet (15 m ) in length.

Cables for RS485 can extend up to 4,000 feet (1,200 m).
