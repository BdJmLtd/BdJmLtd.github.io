The **annual volume of water losses** is an important indicator in assessing water utility efficiency,
both in **individual years** and as **a trend over a period of years**.

High and increasing water losses are an indicator of ineffective planning and construction,
and also of low operational maintenance activities.

> High and increasing water losses --> ineffective planning and construction

Key to establish a strategy for management water losses is to
gain a better understanding of **the reasons for losses** and **the factors** which influence its components.

In recent years, IWA Task Forces have developed and tested the usage of **Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI)**
as a water losses performance indicator.
ILI accommodates the fact that **real losses will always exist**,
even in the very best and well managed distribution system.
The international performance indicator (PI) can give the most rational technical basis for
comparisons water losses between utilities,
which can be used by the operators to measure their attempt in water losses reduction.

## International Water Balance

Any discussion relating to **water losses** must be preceded by a clear definition of **water balance components**.

```text
water balance components ---> water losses
```

> 在理解water losses之前，先要理解water balance component

Water balance is based on measurements or estimations of (i) **water produced**,
(ii) **water imported and exported**, (iii) **water consumed**, and (iv) **water lost**.

> 在不考虑(ii)的情况下，water produced = water consumed + water lost

The water balance calculation provides a guide to estimate how much is lost as **leakage from the network** ('real' losses),
and how much is due to **nonphysical losses** ('apparent' losses).
This calculation allows the practitioner to answer the question of 'how much water is being lost?'

> water loss的构成因素，就是两种：物理因素（leakage from the network）和非物理因素（nonphysical losses）

The water balance is computed over a 12-month period, thus represented the annual average of all components.
The components of water balance should always be calculated as **volume**
before any attempts is made to calculate **performance indicators**.

## Water Losses and Leakage

### Non-Revenue Water

**Non-revenue water** is a volume of water
which enters the distribution system but does not give any revenue to the utility, loss of revenue.
**NRW** includes not only the **real losses** and **apparent losses**, but also the **unbilled authorized consumption**.

```text
NRW = real losses + apparent losses + unbilled authorized consumption
```

**Unbilled authorized consumption** is normally only a small component of the water balance.
Its includes items such as fire fighting, flushing of mains and sewers,
cleaning of distribution storage tanks, filling of water tankers, public hydrants, street cleaning,
watering of municipal gardens, public fountains, frost protection, etc.
They may be metered or unmetered, according to local practice.

The available documentations of such usages often show that
**the volumes of unbilled authorised consumption are unnecessarily high**.
It can be managed down to lower annual volumes without influencing operation efficiency of customer service standards.
**For this reason, such volumes should be metered wherever feasible.**

### Water Losses

Besides definition as mentioned above,
**water losses** can also be defined as a difference between **NRW** and **unbilled authorized consumption**.

It is important to differentiate between **water loss** and **leakage**,
since not all losses are the result of leaking pipe and poor infrastructure.

> 注意概念区分：water loss和leakage

**Water loss** is **apparent losses** (non-physical losses and management losses) and **real losses** (physical losses).

**Leakage** is usually the major component of **water loss** in developed countries.
But this is not always the case in developing countries,
where illegal connections, meter error or accounting errors are often more significant.
Water theft and illegal connection are often the result of local customs,
combined with tariff structures or inadequate metering policies.

As the magnitude of the two components of water losses, **real and apparent losses**, is known, it is possible to:

- Predict the **potential savings** (from **real losses**) and **potential revenue increases** (from **apparent losses**).
- Develop real and apparent losses reduction strategy.
- Set realistic targets.

Not all countries have the luxury or well-developed network infrastructure.
Many are struggling to ensure that their customers receive a reasonable water supply to sustain health and life,
often in a network with outdated infrastructure, poor record systems,
inadequate technical skills and technology, an unsuitable tariff structure or revenue collection policy,
and a poor operation and maintenance policy.
Programme to reduce apparent losses will usually dependent on longer term of changes to metering,
regulatory and legislative policies.

## Factors Influencing Real Losses

There are several local factors which constrain performance in managing real losses.
Based on a reference data set of 27 diverse water distribution systems in 20 countries,
it was found that these factors can vary widely between individual distribution systems, i.e.:

- (i) **length of mains**,
- (ii) **number of service connections**,
- (iii) **location of customer meters on service connections**,
- (iv) **average operating pressure**,
- and (v) **continuity of supply**.

The real losses in the water balance are the leakage occurs in the distribution system up to the metering point.
Therefore, the '**number of service connections**' is logically preferable to the 'number of properties',
since there is a possibility that a single service connection serves a much larger properties.
However, even where apartments are individually metered,
the water balance calculation is usually based on the leakage up to a single master meter on the service connection.

In many systems, the **customer meter** is located close to the street/property's boundary and
the service pipe between the main and the customer meter is owned and maintained by the water utility.
In case the customer meter is located some distance after the street /property's boundary,
the leakage on the private pipe between the street/property's boundary and the customer meter
should be included in the real losses component.
It should be considered since the practitioner experiences that, in most well run systems,
**the largest volume of real losses** is associated with **service connections** rather than **main**.

Many countries recognize **pressure control** as a technique for managing leakage,
but there are local limits to the lowest acceptable average pressures that can be achieved.
The average frequency with which new leaks occur, and rates of flow of individual leaks,
is very sensitive to operating pressures.
The observed weighted average relationship for large systems appears to be that
leakage rates vary with pressure to the power of 1.15.
The simplified formula is that leakage rate vary linearly with operating pressure except at very high of very low pressure.

**The percentage of time for which the distribution system is pressurized** is an important parameter
to be included in real losses estimation.
This can be achieved by expressing the annual volume of real losses as a volume per day
'when the system is pressurized' (w.s.p.).
The average operating pressure should also be calculated over the period when system is pressurized.

Besides the local factors mentioned above, **the type of soil/ground** can influence the frequencies of leaks and burst,
and the speed with which leaks and bursts become visible at ground surface.
These real losses can be undetected for a long period.
However, correct selection and laying of pipe materials and modern leakage control methods
can reduce these influences significantly.

## Performance Indicators for Management of Real Losses

**Performance indicators** provided in the Manual of Best Practice of IWA
which are used to compare the performance of water losses management are:

- Water losses and real losses as a % of system input volume.
- Water losses per house connection.
- **Water losses per km of mains per day** (density of connections < 20 per km of mains).
- **Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI)**.

### The Infrastructure Leakage Index, ILI

In 1997 Allan Lambert realized the need for a **real losses performance indicator**
which would allow international comparisons between systems with very different characteristics,
e.g. intermittent supply situations, low and high pressure systems, differences in consumption levels and so on.
Therefore, IWA recommended the use of **ILI**, abbreviation of **Infrastructure Leakage Index**,
which is categorized as **level-3 indicator** i.e. indicators that provide the greatest amount of specific detail
but are still relevant at the top management level.

The **ILI**, which in the first few years known to only a few insiders,
is now widely accepted and used by practitioners around the world,
as it best describes the efficiency of the real loss management of water utilities.
It is a measurement of how well a distribution network is managed
(maintained, repaired, and rehabilitated) for the control of **real losses**, at the current operating pressure.

**ILI** is the ratio of **Current Annual Real Losses (CARL)** to **Unavoidable Annual Real Losses (UARL)**,
or **ILI = CARL / UARL**.
**Being a ratio, the ILI has no units** and
thus facilitates comparisons between countries that use different measurement units (metric, U.S., British).

### Concept of Infrastructure Leakage Index

This section describes the concept of ILI,
to get better understanding how **water balance** and
**ILI** could identify the priorities to address in leakage management strategy.

#### Real Losses Management Strategy

ILI can be better explained using Figure 3, which shows primary components of leakage management.
The area of the large rectangle represents the **Current Annual Real Losses (CARL)** for any specific system.
**As the system ages, there is a tendency for natural increasing rate of real losses through new leaks and burst**,
some of which will not be reported to the utility.

**This tendency** is controlled and managed by some combination of the four primary components,
namely (i) **pipeline and assets management**,
(ii) **pressure management** (which may increase or decrease the pressure),
(iii) **speed and quality of repairs**,
and (iv) **active leakage control** to locate unreported leaks.

{: refdef}

The number of new leaks arising each year is influenced primarily by **long-term pipeline management**.
Replacing an old main with a new installation will undoubtedly reduce leakage from the main.
However, unless the service connections are also renewed, the benefit may not be as great as first estimated.

Reducing the time it takes to repair a leak will also reduce the volume of leakage.
The average duration of the leaks is limited by the **speed and quality of repairs**,
and the **active leakage control strategy** controls how long unreported leaks run before they are located.

Real losses can be severe, and may go undetected for months or even years.
**The volume lost** will depend on **the characteristics of the pipe network** and
**the leak detection and repair policy** practiced by the utility, i.e.:

- The pressure in the network.
- The frequency and typical flow rates of new leaks and bursts.
- The proportions of new leaks which are 'reported'.
- The 'awareness' time (how quickly the loss is noticed).
--The 'location' time (how quickly each new leaks is located).
--The repair time (how quickly it is repaired or shut off).
--The level of 'background' leakage (undetectable small leakage).

**Pressure management** is one of the fundamental elements of a well-organized leakage management strategy.
The effective schemes are those which cover a large area and which make a significant impact on average pressures.

The benefits of pressure management are:

- Extension of the life of the distribution infrastructure.
- Reduction of new burst frequencies on distribution mains and service connections.
- Reduction of flow rates of all leaks and bursts present in the system at any time.
- Reduction of new leaks on private pipes and overflows at private storage tanks.
- Reduction of some components of consumption subject to direct mains pressure.

#### Unavoidable Annual Real Losses, UARL

Leakage management practitioners are well aware that **real losses will always exist, even in the very best systems**.
The volume of **Unavoidable Annual Real Losses (UARL)**
which is the lowest technically achievable annual real losses for a well maintained and well managed system,
is represented in Figure 3 by the smaller inner rectangle.
**The difference between CARL (large rectangle) and UARL (small rectangle) is the potentially recoverable real losses.**

**UARL** is a useful concept as it can be used to predict, with reasonable reliability,
the lowest technical annual real losses for any combination of **mains length**,
**number of connections**, **customer meter location at current operating pressures**,
assuming that the system is in good condition with high standards for management of real losses and
there are no financial or economic constraints.

It is just a question of how high these UARL will be.
IWA Task Forces have developed a 'user friendly' pressure-dependent formula
for predicting UARL values in a wide range of distribution systems, i.e.:

UARL (litres/day) = (18 x Lm + 0.8 x Nc + 25 x Lp) x P

Where `Lm` is mains length in `km`,
`Nc` is number of service connections,
`Lp` is the **total length of underground pipe** between the edge of the street and customer meters in `km`,
and `P` is **average operating pressure** in **meter**.

This formula considers real losses for modeling and calculation purposes:

- **Background losses** from undetectable leaks (i.e. at joints and fittings),
  which flow rates too low for sonic detection if non-visible.
  Typically **low flow rates** and **long durations**.

- Losses from reported leaks and bursts, based from experiences of frequency, typical flow rate, average duration target.
  Typically **high flow rates** but **short duration**.

- Losses from unreported leaks and bursts, based from experiences of frequency, typical flow rate, average duration target.
  Typically **moderate flow rates** but **durations depend on the method and intensity of active leakage control**.

- **Pressure**, whereas the correlation between **pressure** and **leakage** rate assumes to be linear.

With current knowledge and experience, UARL can be calculated for any system with more than 5000 service connections,
density of connections greater than 20 per km mains, and operating pressure between 25-100 metres.

## Application of ILI

**Although a well managed system can have an ILI of 1.0 (CARL = UARL),
this does not necessarily have to be the target as the ILI is a purely technical performance indicator and
does not take economic considerations into account.**
**For any water distribution system there is a level of leakage
below which is it not cost-effective to make further investment
or use additional resources to drive leakage down further.**
In other words, the value of the water saved is less than the cost of making further reduction.
